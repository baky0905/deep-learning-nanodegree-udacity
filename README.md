### **CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier**

Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, I learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
Given an image of a dog, my algorithm identified an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I made important design decisions about the user experience for the app. 
By completing this lab, I understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. 
Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. 
My imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
